# High-level Overview

We use sample **SD386613** as an example for discussion, since it was loaded three times.

## What Has Already Been Clarified

1. **MinKNOW Report Based on Adaptive Sequencing**
   - The **20.22%** of reads refer to those located within the specified target region (**chrX**) from the **entire sample** (loaded three times).
   - The report provides a general profile of the target region (**chrX**) across the **whole flowcell**.
     - The **coverage of chrX (146.71×)** in this report reflects the coverage status across the entire sample (**159.501×**).
   - The purpose of the metrics in this report is to quickly provide a general overview of the target region (**chrX**) for the **entire sample**.

2. The coverage results (chrX) from the **entire sample** and **MinKNOW Report** are similar & this is **expected**
   - 146.71x VS 159.501x
